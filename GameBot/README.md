# Game Bot
Here's how you build the bot manually. 
Feel free to adjust the code - after all it's your bot!
You can also use the GitHub action in the .github/workflows folder to build and push the bot.    

### Build using an azure container registry with the name myveryownregistry
```
az acr build --image gamebot:latest --registry myveryownregistry --file Dockerfile .
```
